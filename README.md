<h1>Description</h1>
<br>
<p>A while ago, i got interested in observing and trying to figure out how obtuse C-code works.<br>
During the excitementm i came upon this code, which is<u><b>NOT</b> written or modified by me</u>, <br>
Still, it's one of the funest code, i've seen. If yu get a chance, compile it and type stuff, and check the output,<br>
Brings a smile on the face :D !!</p>
